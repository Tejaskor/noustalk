                    Where Your Clients pay for Your services through the Services, in addition to the terms of the

                </p>
                <li>We reserve the right to cause Stripe to hold back funds received in Your Stripe account for up to 45
                    business days prior to making the funds available to You.</li>
                <li>You authorize that outstanding sums due and owing as a result of chargebacks, ACH rejects or

                    accounts for such purpose on a daily basis and that non-sufficient funds for these debits, or
                    blocking or otherwise rendering inaccessible any such deposit accounts, are grounds for an increase
                    in fees, suspension of the Services or termination of this Agreement. In the event of any such
                    occurrence leading to non-payment of any sums due for Chargebacks or otherwise, NousTalk reserves
                    the right to withdraw such sums from Your biller accounts, offset or net settle these sums (i.e.,
                    deduct funds owed from disbursements to You), against future deposits, or withhold future deposits
                    until such sums are paid in full, at any time to ensure payment of the same. The foregoing rights
                    survive termination of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>In the event of a Chargeback, You will be responsible to refund (or allow NousTalk to chargeback
                    from You) the fee imposed on NousTalk by the payment processor.</li>
                <li>NousTalk reserves the right to suspend Your Stripe account in the event of excessive disputes or
                    chargebacks.
                </li>
                <li>NousTalk reserves the right to withhold payment to You of the funds in Your Stripe account to review
                    for suspicious or fraudulent activity and to prevent payouts during the review period.</li>
                <li>NousTalk reserves the right to withhold payment to You of the funds in Your Stripe account when a
                    lien or levy has been placed on Your Account and to prevent payouts until the lien or levy is
                    resolved.
                </li>
                <li>NousTalk reserves the right to refund transactions that have been classified as fraudulent after
                    investigation.
                </li>
                <li>NousTalk reserves the right to deny online payment processing for any reason, including for fraud or
                    other suspicious activity.
                </li>
                <li>You will ensure that no payments are processed in any country sanctioned by the U.S. Office of
                    Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which list may be updated by OFAC from time to time.

                <p><b>25.1</b> <b class="heading">Government Use : </b> If the Service is being used by or on behalf of
                    the United States Government or another governmental entity, then the following provision applies.
                    The Services are “commercial computer software” and/or “commercial computer software documentation”
                    as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 C.F.R. Chapter 1, or “FAR”) 2.101 or similar law,
                    regulation or provision. In accordance with FAR 12.212, Department of Defense FAR Supplement

                    Agreement and is prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement. All terms of
                    this Agreement apply except to the limited extent the U.S. government or other governmental entity
                    is prohibited by federal or other procurement law from agreeing to such terms. If and to the extent
                    any provision in this Agreement is so prohibited, such provision shall be deemed modified only to
                    the extent reasonably necessary to conform to applicable law while giving maximum effect to the
                    Agreement as written.</p>
                <p><b>25.2</b> <b class="heading">Export Controls and Sanctions Compliance : </b> The Services originate
                    in the United States, and are subject to United States export control and sanctions laws, including
                    the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and the regulations of the U.S. Department of the
                    Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The Services may not be directly or indirectly
                    exported or re-exported to: (a) any person or entity to whom the provision of such Services is
                    prohibited under the EAR (including the prohibition on providing items subject to the EAR to anyone
                    on the EAR Entity List or Denied Person List); (b) any country or territory subject to a
                    comprehensive embargo by the United States (currently Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the
                    Crimea, Donetsk People’s Republic, and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine) without
                    appropriate licensing authority; or (c) any person or entity who has been prohibited from
                    participating in U.S. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. Government (including
                    any person or entity identified on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals (“SDNs”) or any
                    entity that is fifty percent (50%) or more owned by one or more SDNs). In addition, the Services may
                    be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United
                    States and foreign laws related to use of the Services.</p>
                <h4>26. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>In the event of a dispute between you and noustalk (including any dispute over the validity,
                    enforceability, or scope of this dispute resolution provision), other than with respect to claims
                    for injunctive relief and disputes that qualify for small claims court, the dispute will be resolved
                    by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or
                    jury. If you do not want to be bound by this arbitration provision, you may opt out. In order to opt
                    out of this arbitration provision, you must notify noustalk in writing that you do not want to
                    resolve disputes with us by arbitration, and such notice should be delivered by mail to 2834
                    colorado avenue, santa monica, ca 90404 within 30 days of the earlier of (a) the date you first
                    access or use the services; and (b) the date you click or tap any button or box marked “accept,”
                    “agree,” or “ok” (or a similar term) in connection with this agreement.</p>
                <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its
                    Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Agreement. The Consumer Arbitration Rules are
                    available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer%20Rules.pdf"
                        class="fw-bold" target="_blank">Consumer Rules</a>, as amended by this
                    Agreement. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference,
                    rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by You or
                    NousTalk that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a
                    location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to
                    travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such
                    determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will follow
                    the terms of this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to
                    award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific
                    performance of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
                    individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and
                    enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in
                    this Agreement will preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local
                    agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against NousTalk for You. </p>
                <p>You agree that this Agreement and the relationship between You and NousTalk shall be governed by the
                    Federal Arbitration Act and the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law
                    principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. If You opt out of
                    arbitration pursuant to the terms above, then the following jurisdiction and venue provision shall
                    apply: All Disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement for which arbitration does not apply
                    will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the province and federal courts located
                    in the City of Waterloo and the Province of Ontario. Notwithstanding this, each party shall still be
                    allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce that party’s
                    Intellectual Property Rights in any court of competent jurisdiction where the other party resides or
                    has its principal place of business.
                </p>
                <h6>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h6>
                <p>You agree that any proceedings to arbitrate, litigate or otherwise resolve a dispute in any forum
                    arising out of or relating to this agreement will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class
                    arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your dispute with
                    other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a
                    representative capacity or as a private attorney general are not permitted and are waived by you,
                    and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims. If a court or arbitrator finds that
                    the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then
                    the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and
                    proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other
                    provision of this dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision
                    will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.
                </p>
                <h4>27. Assignment of Agreement and Account</h4>
                <p>You may not assign this Agreement or Your Account without Our prior written consent. You may not
                    transfer or sublicense any licenses granted by NousTalk in this Agreement without Our prior written
                    consent. We may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and all related rights, licenses,
                    benefits and obligations, without restriction, including the right to sublicense any rights and
                    licenses under this Agreement without Your consent.
                </p>
                <h4>28. Integration, Construction, Interpretation of Section Headings and Severability</h4>
                <p>The agreements, understandings and policies referenced in this Agreement sets forth the entire
                    agreement and understanding between You and NousTalk with respect to the subject matter hereof and
                    supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings. NousTalk reserves the right to
                    modify this Agreement at any time upon notification to You as provided in Section 29 (Notices). If
                    any future change is unacceptable to You, You should discontinue using the Services. Your continued
                    use of the Services will always indicate Your acceptance of this agreement and any changes to it.
                </p>
                <p>You acknowledge that no other written, oral or electronic communications will serve to modify or
                    supplement this Agreement, and You agree not to make any claims inconsistent with this understanding
                    or in reliance on communications not part of this Agreement. The section headings used herein,
                    including descriptive summary sentences at the start of each section, are for convenience only and
                    shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. All terms defined in the singular will have
                    the same meanings when used in the plural, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified. Any use
                    of the term “including” or variations thereof in these Terms will be construed as if followed by the
                    phrase “without limitation.” If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of
                    competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then in such jurisdiction that
                    provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and
                    enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>
