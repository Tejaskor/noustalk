                                some cases, less protective than the laws of other countries. By providing us with your
                                Personal Information and using the Services, you acknowledge that your Personal
                                Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States and other

                            <p>Social Media Widgets: Our Services may include social media features, such as the

                                mini-programs that run on our websites (collectively referred to as “Features”). These
                                Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting, and may set a cookie
                                to enable the Feature to function properly. The Features are either hosted by a third
                                party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these Features on a
                                third-party site are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
                            <p>Links to Other Sites: The Services may contain links to other sites that are not owned or

                                to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects Personal

                            <p>Children’s Privacy: The Services we provide to our Customers are not directed to, nor do
                                we knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that
                                we have received any Personal Information directly from a child under the age of 13
                                without first receiving the child’s parent’s verified consent, we will use that Personal
                                Information only to respond directly to that child (or the parent or legal guardian) to
                                inform the child that he or she cannot use the Services. We will then subsequently
                                delete that child’s Personal Information. If you believe that a child under 13 may have
                                provided us with Personal Information, please contact us at <a
